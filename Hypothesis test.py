# i have two product product A and product B.
# average revenue from product A is 100
# average revennue from product B is 200

# we product we should keep more in my store? ProductB

# average revenue from product A is 100
# average revenue from product B is 80

# we product we should keep more in the store? product A - fail to get more
# revenue from your business in next month.
# we started facing loss. why?


if we get p value = 0.03 :
    - accept null hypothesis at alpha 1% - type 2 error
    - reject null hypothesis at alpha 5% - ideal case



step-1
H0: AVG thickness = 0.04
H1: AVG thickness != 0.04

Step-2
Alpha = 5% - significance value = 0.05
confidence value = 1-significance = 0.05

step-3
z-DISTRIBUTION

z = 1.96


STDERROR = 0.04 (0.04/SQR(n))

sample mean = 0.0408

t = (sample mean - h0)/stderror

T = (0.0408-0.04)/0.004 = 0.20
p(t) = 0.793

p-value = 1-p(t) = 0.927

Step-4
lower limit = 0.04-1.96*0.004 = 0.03216
upper limit = 0.04+1.96*0.004 = 0.04784

step-5

as sample mean is lies within confidence limit, so we accept H0
